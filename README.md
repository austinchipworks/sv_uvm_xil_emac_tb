==================

Systemverilog UVM testbench for Xilinx EMAC

- This sample UVM testbench is for a Virtex5 EMAC with a wrapper generated by Xilinx's Coregen tool
- The actual design has not been uploaded, to prevent any infringement of Xilinx's copyright.
- So to simulate, you will have to generate the design using Coregen.

1. Bring up Xilinx Coregen
  - select a Virtex 5 part
  - In project options, choose verilog for the language
  - Choose the V5_trimac
  - Configure the trimac to use GMII, single EMAC
  - Click generate
2. In the coregen directory, goto v5_*/simulation/
3. From git get the tar file uvm_xilinx_emac_tb.tgz
4. Untar in the v5_*/simulation directory
5. cd to v5_*/simulation/functional directory, this where the UVM testbench files reside

The next set of instructions are for simulating in VCS
6. Compile xilinx libraries using compxlib
  - compxlib -arch virtex5 -dir <dir_to_put_compiled_output>  -lib all -verbose -s vcs_mx -l verilog
6. Check that synopsys_sim.setup is in v5_*/simulation/functional
7. Compile using: make build 
8. Simulate using: make run
9. Waves using: make waves
10. cleanup: make clean
